# Better-Words
A Slackbot that helps you choose better words.

### Introduction
----

One day, we realized that many people say `you guys` quite often, which is not an inclusive term to a majority of people. That spiraled off into a whole conversation about different words that may be harmful and hurtful in all sorts of contexts.

As a community, we decided that we have a choice, and also an opportunity to improve the words we choose to be more inclusive to all kinds of people (and animals if they know how to use Slack). As a result, this repo is here for us to build a Slackbot that will privately prompt a user within a Slack conversation to choose a friendlier word if they happen to use a term that has better alternatives.

### Getting started

We're using [this](https://medium.com/@pvzig/building-slack-bots-in-swift-b99e243e444c#.o36cksecb) guide to learn how to build a Slackbot.
